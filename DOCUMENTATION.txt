TXTParsing.java

The file TXTParsing.java is a Java class file that contains a static method parse which takes a file path as input and returns a list of MyDoc objects.

The purpose of this file seems to be parsing a text file and extracting information from it. It reads the entire file into a string, splits the string 
into individual documents, and then parses each document to extract the ID, title, and content. The parsed documents are stored in a list of MyDoc objects 
and returned as the result.

Additionally, the code includes some print statements for debugging purposes, which display the number of documents read, the parsed document details, 
and the number of parsed documents.
